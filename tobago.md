# Apache Tobago

The goal of Apache Tobago is to provide the community with a well-designed set of user 
interface components based on JSF and run on MyFaces or other JSF implementations.

Tobago is more than just a tag library. The following statements characterize Tobago and make 
it different from other frameworks:

  * The focus of Tobago is to create business applications without the need of coding
    HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The development of Tobago pages follows more the development of
    conventional user interfaces than the creation of web pages.

  * The UI components are abstracted from HTML and any layout information that does
    not belong to the general page structure. The final output format is determined
    by the client/user-agent.

  * A theming mechanism makes it easy to change the look and feel and to provide
    special implementations for certain browsers. A fallback solution ensures that
    as much code is reused for new themes as possible.

  * A layout manager is used to arrange the components automatically. This means, no
    manual laying out with HTML tables or other constructs is needed.
